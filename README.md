# 🛠️ Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

This project is a hands-on network traffic analysis task completed during my cybersecurity internship. It involves capturing live packets using Wireshark and identifying key network protocols such as ARP, DNS, HTTP, TCP, and TLS.

## 📌 Objective

To understand and analyze how different network protocols work by capturing and filtering real-time traffic using Wireshark.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) – open-source network protocol analyzer

## ✅ How I Did It

1. Installed Wireshark on my system.
2. Started packet capture on my active network interface.
3. Opened websites and ran commands like `ping` and `nslookup` to generate traffic.
4. Stopped the capture after ~2 minutes.
5. Used filters like `arp`, `dns`, `http`, and `tls` to analyze specific protocols.
6. Exported the capture file and documented my findings.

## 🔍 Protocols Identified

- **ARP** – Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.
- **DNS** – Resolves domain names to IPs.
- **HTTP** – Plaintext web traffic.
- **TCP** – Reliable connection protocol.
- **TLSv1.2/1.3** – Secures HTTPS connections.

## 📄 Deliverables

- Packet capture: `pingoogle.pcap`
- Report: 'Task-5' (Short summary of protocols and findings)
